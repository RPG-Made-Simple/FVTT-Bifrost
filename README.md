A FoundryVTT library that provides a **system-agnostic ~~[API]()~~ (WIP)**  to interact with Foundry without worrying about system implementation details.

> [!NOTE]
> This **system-agnostic** approach requires the system to be supported by Bifrost, and that requires a custom ~~[`Bridge`]()~~ (WIP) implementation.

> [!TIP]
> If you are developing a system, please consider [supporting]() Bifrost by supplying your own ~~[`Bridge`]()~~ (WIP) implementation, that way you can make your system compatible with all the modules that use Bifrost as the interface to interact with system-specific info.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please, do not use Bifrost on games where you do not completely trust your players. The module exposes some API functionalities that are not completely safe, **items can be created and deleted** anywhere when using Bifrost, so be careful while using the module.
>
> This will be fixed in a near future, but for now if you are in doubt, don't use Bifrost yet!

Do you like the module? Consider supporting it :)
