This documentation presents everything you need in order to use the module.

## Scope
The entire module documentation is here, but most of it is intended to be used
by the people developing the module, if want to just use the [`API`]() then you
only need to worry about the [`API`]() topic.

Everything else is related to the core of the module, but it can help you find
answers to strange behaviors and bugs.

## Typescript
The most important thing you have to keep in mind is that Bifrost is developed
with `typescript`, but you can use regular `javascript` with the module, it just
requires a little bit of effort.

> But we still recommend you to use `typescript`.
